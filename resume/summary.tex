\begin{cvparagraph}

Third year Aerospace Engineering and Advanced Physics student with an avid interest in serving Australia's developing space industry. I am a multi-disciplinary problem-solver who makes sure to be exposed to and employ a diverse range of technologies in my projects and studies. I have experience in robotics, electrical and mechatronic subsystem design, web development, academic research, and as a glider pilot. I wish to expand to space-based technologies, space operations, machine learning, and software development.
